Shows contributors to a Github repo, retrieved via the GitHub API.

== Description ==
A Community Building Tool By [Pods](http://pods.io/pods)

To output as HTML via PHP, use `echo acknowledge_me_display( $owner, $repo, $header_text = false, $total = 100 )` where `$owner` is the user name or organization name for the repo, and `$repo` is the repo name. Optionally add some header text or change the limit for the number of contributors.

Example, show 50 contributors to `https://github.com/pods-framework/pods/` with `acknowledge_me_display( 'pods-framework', 'pods', 'Pods Is Brought To You By:', 50 );`

Or use shortcode `[acknowledge_me owner="pods-framework" repo="pods" header_text="Pods Is Brought To You By:" total="50"]`
